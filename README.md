# quantum-circuit

This application was initially designed as a command-line interface for a project at university [see repo:].
The current repository is an adaptation of that functionality to a GUI format, where the back-end has been improved compared to the initial code and a QML front-end is attached to it.
**NOTE: This repo is currently not complete!**
