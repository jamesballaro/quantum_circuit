# quantum-circuit

This application was initially designed as a command-line interface for a project at university [see repo:].
The current repository is an adaptation of that functionality to a GUI format, where the back-end has been improved compared to the initial code and a QML front-end is attached to it.
NOTE: This repo is currently not complete!

How to run: 
```
git clone 
cmake -S . -B .
make
./build/quantum-circuit
```
